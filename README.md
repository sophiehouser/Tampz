# Tampon Run

A game to start thought and discussion about menstruation stigmas. Andrea Gonzales and I released it in 2014 and it went viral overnight, garnering press globally.

See the final, public repo here: https://github.com/andrea-3000/tampon-run and the live, playable version at www.tamponrun.com.
